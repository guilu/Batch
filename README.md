###A lovingly designed and crafted suite of 300 (and counting) icons for web and user interface design by [@adamwhitcroft](https://twitter.com/adamwhitcroft).

---
#My fork adds an .css file to rule the icons like the fontawesome.io project

##Instalation


The mechanic is simple:

Download the .css file and add the style to your page

	<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/font-batch.css">

And then use the class anywhere in your file:

	<i class="fb fb-1"></i>
	<i class="fb fb-2"></i>
	...
	<i class="fb fb-267"></i>

###easiest way...
Even easier? Yes you can! You don't even have to download it, simply put this link in your page and you are good to go:

	<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://raw.github.com/guilu/Batch/master/CSS/font-batch.css">


I didn't name them, but it would be nice, though.


All the icons (in a sample page...)
